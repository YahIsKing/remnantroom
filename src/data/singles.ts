    lyrics: `Verse
    The Lord stands to judge the land
The proud have fallen by His hand
Daughters of Zion, walking tall
Eyes of pride, but soon to fall

Tinkling steps, outstretched necks
Braided gold and costly dress
But in His fire, all is stripped
Perfume fades and beauty slips

Chorus
And in that day, we will cry
Take away our shame, don't let us die
We'll bring our food, we'll wear our clothes
Just give your name, to bear the load

Verse
The LORD removes their finery
Chains and veils, their luxury
Instead of sweet perfume—decay
A rope where beauty used to lay

We thought we ruled, we laughed in pride
But truth has stripped the veil we hide
Our men have fallen in the street
And now our songs are incomplete

Chorus
And in that day, we will cry
Take away our shame, don't let us die
We'll bring our food, we'll wear our clothes
Just give your name, to bear the load

Bridge
Yet out of ashes, shoots will rise
The Branch of God before our eyes
The remnant pure shall dwell in peace
A holy flame that won't decrease

Chorus
And in that day, He'll be our crown
The shame we wore will be cast down
The cloud by day, the fire by night
Shall shelter us in holy light

We'll bring our food, we'll wear our clothes
Just give your name… to bear the load`,

    lyrics: `Verse
    El Señor se alza a juzgar
Los soberbios caen sin par
Hijas de Sión caminan así
Con ojos de orgullo pronto a morir

Pasos suaves cuello erguido
Oro trenzado vestido fino
Mas en su fuego todo se va
Perfume muere belleza no está

Chorus
Y en aquel día clamaremos
Quita la culpa no moriremos
Traeremos pan ropas también
Danos tu nombre para bien

Verse
El Señor quita su adorno y luz
Velos cadenas sin virtud
En vez de aroma corrupción
Una soga fue su lección

Reímos llenas de vanidad
Mas la verdad quitó claridad
Nuestros hombres yacen allí
Y ya no hay canto dentro de mí

Chorus
Y en aquel día clamaremos
Quita la culpa no moriremos
Traeremos pan ropas también
Danos tu nombre para bien

Bridge
De las cenizas brotará flor
El Retoño santo del Señor
El resto puro vivirá en paz
Llama eterna que arderá

Chorus
Y en aquel día Él será corona
La vieja culpa será derrotada
Nube de día fuego al andar
Su santa luz nos cubrirá

Traeremos pan ropas también
Danos tu nombre para bien

Ahh ahh ahh`,

    lyrics: `Verse
    Ten waitin'
Into the night
Lamps lit low
Everything right
Five had oil
Hearts of faith
Five just hoped
Their's would last the same

The hours dragged on
The light grew thin
As they wondered
When they'd see Him
Some hearts were calm
Some filled with doubt
But only He could know
When they'd hear the shout

Chorus
So Keep your lamp filled right
Be ready for that midnight cry
Cause you don't know the day or hour
When the Bridegroom will arrive
Will you have oil when darkness falls?
Will you be ready when He calls?
Don't let your fire fade tonight
Keep burnin'
Keep burnin'
Till the morning light

Verse
At midnight came
That cry so loud
Wake up and see
He's coming now!
The foolish saw
Their fire was dim
They'd waited too late
To be ready for Him

Give us yours
They pled in fear
The wise said no
The shops are near

Chorus
So Keep your lamp filled right
Be ready for that midnight cry
Cause you don't know the day or hour
When the Bridegroom will arrive
Will you have oil when darkness falls?
Will you be ready when He calls?
Don't let your fire fade tonight
Keep burnin'
Keep burnin'
Till the morning light

Bridge
While they went to buy the oil
That's when He showed
5 went in
And the door was closed
5 returned
Only to find
The one they called LORD cried
You were never mine

Chorus
Keep your lamps burning bright
Be ready for that midnight cry
Cause We don't know the day or hour
When the Bridegroom will arrive
Will we have oil when darkness falls?
Will we be ready when He calls?
Don't let your fire fade tonight
Keep burnin'
Keep burnin'
Till the morning light

Watch therefore
Watch and pray
You know not the hour or the day`,

    lyrics: `Verse
    There was a man
After Yah's own heart
They love his psalms
But not the parts
Where he walked in a way
That most men won't
Cause they've been told
That Yah said don't

But I wonder what they'd say
If they saw him face to face
Would they call his blessings shame
Or would they recall
The one who gave
The one who gave
The one who gave
The one who gave

Chorus
He anointed his head
Gave him a name
He set the crown
Gave him the reign
All of the wives
And arrows they bore
And He said son
Ida given you more
So don't call evil
What He made
And don't forget
When you speak his name
It was Yah that gave
And it's Yah who reigns

Verse
They sing of harp and sling in hand
But hate the way his family stands
They preach his words as set apart
While speaking falsely of his heart

But the God who saw his rise and fall
He blessed his house his name it all
So guard your lips before you blame
And remember
It was Yah that gave
And it's Yah who reigns

Chorus
He anointed his head
Gave him a name
He set the crown
Gave him the reign
All of the wives
And arrows they bore
And He said son
Ida given you more
So don't call evil
What He made
And don't forget
When you speak his name
It was Yah that gave
And it's Yah who reigns

Bridge
So tell me now
Before you blame
If He calls it good
Should you call it vain
And if He showed you truth
Would you still profane his name

Chorus
He anointed his head
Gave him a name
He set the crown
Gave him the reign
All of the wives
And arrows they bore
And He said son
Ida given you more
So don't call evil
What He made
And don't forget
When you speak his name
It was Yah that gave
And it's Yah who reigns

Don't forget
When you speak his name
The one who gave
It was Yah that gave

It was grace
It was no mistake
It was Yah that gave`,

    Your law I've hidden
Deep in my heart
That I might not sin
Or from your ways depart
Your precepts teach me
And guide my day
A light to my path
A lamp to my way

More precious than gold
Sweeter than honey
Restoring my soul
Its my joy in your glory
Your law gives me hope
Your word lights my way
I'll follow you forever
I'll follow you forever
And always

Verse
Adonai dont let me hide
From the wonders of your law
Your statutes are my song
On every road I go
When princes mock and try
I stand unashamed
When scoffers breathe out lies
I will glorify your name

Chorus
More precious than gold
Sweeter than honey
Restoring my soul
Its my joy in your glory
Your law gives me hope
Your word lights my way
I'll follow you forever
I'll follow you forever
And always

Bridge
My heart weeps in grief
For you to strengthen me
Adonai
Oh adonai
Make it clean in me
Make it clean in me
Adonai
Oh adonai
Be with me
Be with me

Chorus
More precious than gold
Sweeter than honey
Restoring my soul
Its my joy in your glory
Your law gives me hope
Your word lights my way
I'll follow you forever
I'll follow you forever
